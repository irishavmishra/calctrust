## SEO Strategy Notes

### Long-Tail Focus
Most keywords are **3-5 word phrases** targeting specific search intent:
- "50000 salary in california" (not just "salary calculator")
- "15 dollars an hour annual" (not just "hourly calculator")
- "3 percent raise calculator" (not just "raise calculator")

### Geographic Targeting
- All 50 U.S. states covered
- Major cities included (NYC, Chicago, Seattle, Atlanta, etc.)
- State-specific tax considerations built into each page

### User Intent Mapping
- **Conversion queries:** "X to Y" (salary to hourly, biweekly to annual)
- **Calculation queries:** "how much is X"
- **Tool queries:** "[specific] calculator"
- **Informational:** "what is X after taxes"

### Competitive Advantage
Unlike generic calculator sites, CalcTrust targets:
1. **Specific dollar amounts** ($50k, $75k, not "salary calculator")
2. **State-aware queries** (California, Texas, not generic USA)
3. **Period-specific conversions** (biweekly, weekly, monthly)
4. **Raise percentages** (3%, 5%, 10%, not just "raise")
