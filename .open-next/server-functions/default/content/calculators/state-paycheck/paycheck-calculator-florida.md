## Deep Dive: Florida's Tax-Free Advantage

### Why Florida Has No Income Tax

Florida's constitution prohibits a personal income tax. The state funds operations through:

- **Sales tax**: 6% state rate plus local additions (often 7-8% total)
- **Tourism taxes**: Hotel, rental car, and entertainment taxes
- **Property taxes**: Higher than many states
- **Business taxes**: Various corporate and commercial taxes

This structure shifts tax burden from income to consumption, benefiting high earners significantly.

### The Florida vs. High-Tax State Comparison

| Salary | California Tax | New York Tax | Florida Tax | Annual Savings |
|--------|----------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| $75,000 | ~$3,500 | ~$4,000 | $0 | $3,500-4,000 |
| $100,000 | ~$5,500 | ~$5,500 | $0 | $5,500 |
| $150,000 | ~$10,500 | ~$9,500 | $0 | $9,500-10,500 |
| $300,000 | ~$26,000 | ~$22,000 | $0 | $22,000-26,000 |

A $200,000 earner moving from California to Florida saves approximately $14,000 annually in state income tax alone.

### The Remote Work Migration

Florida has experienced massive population growth from remote workers fleeing high-tax states:

**Top source states for Florida migration**:
1. New York
2. California
3. New Jersey
4. Illinois
5. Massachusetts

Remote workers maintaining the same salary while establishing Florida residency see immediate take-home increases of 5-10%.

### FICA Still Applies

All Florida workers pay federal FICA regardless of state:

- **Social Security**: 6.2% on wages up to $176,100 (2025)
- **Medicare**: 1.45% on all wages
- **Additional Medicare**: 0.9% on wages over $200,000

For most workers, FICA (7.65%) is the primary payroll deduction after federal income tax.
