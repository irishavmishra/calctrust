## Deep Dive: Arizona's Tax-Friendly Environment

### Arizona's 2.5% Flat Tax

Arizona dramatically simplified its tax code in 2023, implementing a flat 2.5% income tax rate for all taxpayers regardless of income level:

**Previous rates (before 2023)**: 2.59% to 4.5% graduated
**Current rate (2023+)**: 2.5% flat for all income levels

This makes Arizona one of the lowest-tax states among those that impose an income tax:

| State | Top Tax Rate | Structure |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| Arizona | 2.5% | Flat |
| Colorado | 4.4% | Flat |
| Utah | 4.65% | Flat |
| California | 13.3% | Graduated |
| Oregon | 9.9% | Graduated |

### The California-to-Arizona Migration

Arizona has become a top destination for California refugees seeking tax relief:

**Comparison for $100,000 salary**:
- California state tax: ~$5,500
- Arizona state tax: ~$2,500
- **Annual savings: ~$3,000**

For a $200,000 earner:
- California state tax: ~$15,000
- Arizona state tax: ~$5,000
- **Annual savings: ~$10,000**

Combined with Arizona's substantially lower cost of living, particularly housing, the total financial benefit of California-to-Arizona relocation is significant.

### Arizona Standard Deductions

Arizona provides standard deductions that reduce taxable income:

- **Single filer**: $14,600 (2025, indexed to federal)
- **Married filing jointly**: $29,200
- **Head of household**: $21,900

These deductions mirror federal amounts, simplifying tax preparation.

### No Local Income Taxes

Unlike some states, Arizona has no local or municipal income taxes. Your Arizona tax burden is entirely at the state level—no additional city taxes complicate withholding or filing.

### FICA Applies to All Workers

Regardless of Arizona's low state rate, all workers pay federal FICA:

- **Social Security**: 6.2% on wages up to $176,100 (2025)
- **Medicare**: 1.45% on all wages
- **Additional Medicare**: 0.9% on wages exceeding $200,000

For most Arizona workers, FICA (7.65%) exceeds Arizona state tax (2.5%).

## Assumptions Used

This calculator uses these assumptions:

- **2025 tax rates**: Federal brackets, Arizona's 2.5% rate, and FICA limits
- **Flat tax applied**: Uses Arizona's current flat 2.5% rate

## Common Mistakes People Make

- **Using old graduated rates**: Arizona switched to 2.5% flat in 2023—old rate schedules are obsolete
- **Forgetting FICA still applies**: 7.65% FICA applies regardless of Arizona's low state rate
- **Ignoring residency requirements**: Arizona taxes require genuine residency, not just a mailing address
- **Overlooking total relocation math**: Factor housing savings alongside tax savings for complete picture
- **Misunderstanding part-year treatment**: Income earned before establishing Arizona residency may be taxed by prior state

---

## Why Results Can Vary by Situation

Actual take-home pay may differ due to:

- **Pre-tax benefit elections**: Health insurance, FSA, HSA reduce taxable income
- **Filing status differences**: Married vs. single impacts federal brackets significantly
- **Additional withholding**: Some employees request extra federal withholding
- **Multiple state taxation**: Part-year residents may owe taxes to multiple states
- **Self-employment**: Self-employment income faces additional SE tax
