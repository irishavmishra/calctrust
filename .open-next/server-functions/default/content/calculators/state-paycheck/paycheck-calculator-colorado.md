## Deep Dive: Colorado's Tax Environment

### Colorado's Flat Tax Rate

Colorado maintains a simple flat income tax of 4.4% (reduced from 4.55% in previous years). This means:

- Entry-level worker earning $35,000: 4.4% rate
- Senior professional earning $200,000: 4.4% rate
- Executive earning $500,000: 4.4% rate

There's no bracket planning needed—Colorado takes the same percentage regardless of income.

### Colorado vs. Neighboring States

| State | Tax Rate | Type |
|-------|----------|------|
| Wyoming | 0% | No income tax |
| Utah | 4.65% | Flat |
| Colorado | 4.4% | Flat |
| New Mexico | 1.7-5.9% | Graduated |
| Nebraska | 2.46-5.84% | Graduated |

Colorado sits in the moderate range—not as favorable as no-tax Wyoming but better than many graduated states.

### Colorado Standard Deduction

Colorado follows federal standard deductions:
- **Single**: $15,000
- **Married filing jointly**: $30,000

This federal conformity simplifies tax preparation.

### The TABOR Effect

Colorado's Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR) limits government revenue growth, resulting in periodic refunds when state revenues exceed limits. These TABOR refunds vary by year but can provide $400-800+ back to taxpayers.
