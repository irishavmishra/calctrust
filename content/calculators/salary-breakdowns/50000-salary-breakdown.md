## Deep Dive: Take-Home Pay on $50,000

### Federal Tax Impact

At $50,000, a single filer falls primarily in the 22% marginal tax bracket, but the effective rate is much lower due to progressive taxation:

**2025 Federal Tax Calculation (Single)**:
- 10% on first $11,925 = $1,192.50
- 12% on $11,926 to $48,475 = $4,386
- 22% on $48,476 to $50,000 = $336
- **Total federal tax: ~$5,914** (11.8% effective rate)

After the $15,000 standard deduction, taxable income is $35,000, reducing actual tax to approximately **$4,000-4,500**.

### State Tax Variation

State taxes dramatically affect take-home pay on $50,000:

| State | Annual State Tax | Monthly Impact |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| Texas (0%) | $0 | +$0 |
| Florida (0%) | $0 | +$0 |
| Arizona (2.5%) | ~$875 | -$73 |
| Colorado (4.4%) | ~$1,540 | -$128 |
| Illinois (4.95%) | ~$1,733 | -$144 |
| California (4-6%) | ~$1,800 | -$150 |
| New York (4-6%) | ~$2,100 | -$175 |
| Oregon (8-9%) | ~$3,500 | -$292 |

A $50,000 earner in Texas keeps approximately $200-300 more per month than the same earner in California or New York.

### FICA Taxes (Unavoidable)

Regardless of state, FICA applies to all wages:
- **Social Security**: $50,000 × 6.2% = $3,100
- **Medicare**: $50,000 × 1.45% = $725
- **Total FICA**: $3,825 (7.65%)

### Net Take-Home Estimates by State

| State | Annual Net | Monthly Net | Biweekly Net |
|-------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| Texas | ~$41,500 | ~$3,458 | ~$1,596 |
| Florida | ~$41,500 | ~$3,458 | ~$1,596 |
| Arizona | ~$40,600 | ~$3,383 | ~$1,562 |
| Colorado | ~$39,900 | ~$3,325 | ~$1,535 |
| California | ~$39,200 | ~$3,267 | ~$1,508 |

## Is $50,000 a Good Salary?

### National Context

- **U.S. median individual income**: ~$45,000 (you're above average)
- **U.S. median household income**: ~$75,000 (below average for households)
- **Percentile ranking**: Approximately 55th percentile for individual earners

### Cost of Living Considerations

$50,000 stretches very differently depending on location:

**High affordability** (Midwest, South):
- Cities like Indianapolis, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Memphis
- Can afford comfortable apartment, car, savings on $50K
- Rent typically $900-1,200 for 1BR

**Moderate affordability** (mid-tier metros):
- Cities like Denver, Phoenix, Atlanta, Austin
- Manageable but requires budget discipline
- Rent typically $1,200-1,600 for 1BR

**Low affordability** (coastal metros):
- Cities like San Francisco, NYC, Boston, Seattle
- Very tight budget, likely need roommates
- Rent often $2,000-3,500+ for 1BR

### The 30% Rule Check

Financial advisors recommend spending no more than 30% of gross income on housing:
- $50,000 × 30% = $15,000/year = **$1,250/month** housing budget

This amount works in many Midwest and Southern cities but falls short in coastal metros where average rents exceed this threshold significantly.
