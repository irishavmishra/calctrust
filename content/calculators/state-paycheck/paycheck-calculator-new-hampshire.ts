      'For wage earners, this makes New Hampshire effectively a no-income-tax state joining Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming in offering this benefit.',
      'The tax advantage is particularly significant for Massachusetts border residents. A Massachusetts worker earning $100,000 pays approximately $5,000 in state income tax. Living in New Hampshire eliminates this that\'s over $400 per month in take-home pay.',
      'Southern New Hampshire (Nashua, Manchester, Salem, Portsmouth) has become a bedroom community for Boston workers. With no income tax and lower property taxes than Massachusetts, many professionals choose NH residency while commuting to Boston jobs.',
      'New Hampshire compensates for no income tax through property taxes (among the highest in the nation) and no sales tax. This creates an interesting tradeoff: renters benefit enormously from NH residency, while homeowners face higher property tax burdens.',
