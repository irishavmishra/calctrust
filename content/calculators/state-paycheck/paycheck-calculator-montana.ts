      'Montana uses a graduated income tax system with two brackets for 2025. The first $20,500 of taxable income is taxed at 4.7%, while income above $20,500 is taxed at 5.9%. This relatively simple structure makes Montana tax calculations straightforward compared to states with multiple brackets.',
      'What makes Montana truly unique is its lack of sales tax. Montana is one of only five states (along with Alaska, Delaware, New Hampshire, and Oregon) that does not collect a statewide sales tax. For residents, this means significant savings on everyday purchases, major appliances, vehicles, and other consumer goods.',
      'For a Montana worker earning $60,000 annually, the state income tax works out to approximately $3,300, making the effective state tax rate about 5.5%. Compare this to Washington state where there is no income tax but high sales taxes, or Wyoming where there is no income tax and low sales tax. Each state offers different trade-offs.',
      'Montana\'s combination of moderate income tax and zero sales tax often benefits middle-income earners who spend a significant portion of their income on taxable goods. High earners may find better overall tax situations in states like Wyoming or Nevada.',
