      "The border decision between Idaho and Washington matters for Spokane-area residents. At $50,000, you're paying about $2,900 to Idaho versus nothing in Washington. At $75,000, it's $4,350 in Idaho. A $100,000 salary costs $5,800 in Idaho taxes. At $150,000, you're sending $8,700 to the state. However, Idaho often offers lower property taxes and housing costs that partially offset these differences.",
