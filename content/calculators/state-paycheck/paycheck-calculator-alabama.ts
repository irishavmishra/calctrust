      "Alabama imposes a graduated income tax with three brackets for 2025:",
      "Single Filers: - 2% on income up to $500 - 4% on income from $501 to $3,000 - 5% on income over $3,000",
      "Married Filing Jointly: - 2% on income up to $1,000 - 4% on income from $1,001 to $6,000 - 5% on income over $6,000",
      "These thresholds are notably lower than federal brackets, meaning most workers quickly reach the top 5% rate. A worker earning $40,000 pays 5% on the vast majority of their income—effectively creating a near-flat tax for middle and higher earners.",
      "Alabama is one of only three states (along with Iowa and Louisiana) that allows taxpayers to deduct federal income taxes from state taxable income. This unique provision reduces your effective Alabama tax burden:",
      "Example: $60,000 salary, single filer - Estimated federal tax: ~$5,500 - Alabama taxable income: $60,000 - $5,500 = $54,500 - This deduction saves approximately $275 in Alabama taxes",
      "This federal tax deductibility partially offsets Alabama's otherwise moderate tax rates.",
      "Several Alabama cities and counties impose local occupational taxes:",
      "- Birmingham: 1% occupational tax - Gadsden: 2% occupational tax - Bessemer: 1% occupational tax - Many other municipalities have local taxes ranging from 0.5% to 2%",
      "These local taxes aren't included in standard state calculations but can significantly impact take-home pay for workers in affected areas. Always verify your specific locality's requirements.",
      "Alabama's tax structure falls in the middle range compared to neighbors:",
      "| State | Top Income Tax Rate | Notes | |-------|---------------------|-------| | Tennessee | 0% | No income tax on wages | | Florida | 0% | No income tax | | Georgia | 5.49% | Flat rate (decreasing to 4.99% by 2029) | | Mississippi | 4.7% | Flat rate | | Alabama | 5% | Graduated, with federal deductibility |",
      "For high earners, Tennessee and Florida offer significant tax savings. However, Alabama's federal tax deduction and relatively low cost of living create competitive overall economics.",
      "- Social Security: 6.2% on wages up to $176,100 (2025) - Medicare: 1.45% on all wages - Additional Medicare: 0.9% on wages exceeding $200,000 (single)",
      "For a worker earning $50,000, FICA totals $3,825 annually—a significant and unavoidable deduction."
