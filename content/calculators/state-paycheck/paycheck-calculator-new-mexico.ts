      'New Mexico uses a four-bracket progressive income tax with rates from 1.7% to 5.9%. The top rate of 5.9% applies to income over $210,000 for single filers, meaning most New Mexicans pay effective rates in the 3-4% range.',

      'The national laboratories (Los Alamos and Sandia) are major employers, attracting scientists and engineers with competitive federal salaries. These higher earners are most affected by NM\'s upper brackets.',
      'Compared to neighboring Texas (0% income tax), New Mexico residents pay meaningful state taxes. However, NM offers services Texas doesn\'t fully fund through other means, and overall cost of living may still favor NM in certain scenarios.',
