      "Single Filers: - 1% on income up to $750 - 2% on income $751 to $2,250 - 3% on income $2,251 to $3,750 - 4% on income $3,751 to $5,250 - 5% on income $5,251 to $7,000 - 5.49% on income over $7,000 (effectively all income for working professionals)",

      "Note: For nearly all working professionals, the top 5.49% rate applies to the vast majority of income making Georgia effectively a near-flat tax state.",
      "Georgia's 5.49% rate positions it favorably in the Southeast. Florida and Tennessee both have zero income tax, making them attractive alternatives for those prioritizing tax savings. North Carolina uses a flat 4.75% rate lower than Georgia. South Carolina's graduated system tops at 6.5%, while Alabama reaches 5%.",
      "The tax cost of living in Georgia versus neighboring no-tax states adds up quickly. At $50,000 in salary, you're paying around $2,745 annually to Georgia that you'd keep in Florida or Tennessee. At $75,000, it's $4,118. A $100,000 earner loses roughly $5,490 to Georgia taxes. At $150,000, you're sending about $8,235 to the state.",
      "For a $100,000 earner, Georgia residence costs approximately $5,500 annually compared to Florida or Tennessee equivalent to $458/month.",
