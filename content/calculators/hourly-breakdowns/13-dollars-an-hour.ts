      '$13 per hour represents an entry-level wage that exceeds the federal minimum but may fall below state minimums in states like California, Washington, and New York. At this rate, annual earnings of $27,040 place you in the lower-middle income bracket for single earners.',
      'Workers earning $13/hour typically qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit if they meet other requirements. This credit can add $600-$3,000+ to annual income depending on filing status and dependents, effectively raising the hourly equivalent by $0.30-$1.50.',
      'Housing affordability is a key concern at this income level. The general guideline suggests spending no more than 30% of gross income on housing, which translates to approximately $676/month at $13/hour. In many U.S. cities, this limits options to shared housing or lower-cost areas.',
