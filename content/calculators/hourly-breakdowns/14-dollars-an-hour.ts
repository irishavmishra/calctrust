    deepDive: [
      '$14 per hour approaches the minimum wage threshold in several high-cost states and represents a living wage floor in many discussions. At $29,120 annually, this income level sits just below the $30,000 mark often used as a baseline for financial stability in lower-cost regions.',
      'At this wage, a worker paying 30% of gross income toward housing can afford approximately $728/month in rent. This is feasible in many Midwest and Southern cities but challenging in coastal metros where average rents exceed $1,500.',
      'The $14/hour rate is a common starting point for warehouse workers, administrative assistants, and customer service representatives. Many employers use this as a stepping stone with structured increases to $16-18/hour after 6-12 months of employment.',
    ],
    examples: [
      'Full-Time Worker: $14/hour × 40 hours × 52 weeks = $29,120/year. Monthly take-home: approximately $2,150-$2,250.',
      'Part-Time Worker (25 hours/week): $14 × 25 × 52 = $18,200/year.',
      'With Overtime (8 hours/week): Regular $560 + OT $168 = $728/week = $37,856/year.',
      'With Holiday Premium (2x for 40 hours/year): Base + $560 holiday = $29,680/year.',
    ],
    expertTips: [
      'Regular overtime at $14/hour can push annual income past $35,000',
      'Negotiate for quarterly performance bonuses common at this level',

      'Track hours carefully—$14/hour x 5 miscounted hours monthly = $840/year lost',
