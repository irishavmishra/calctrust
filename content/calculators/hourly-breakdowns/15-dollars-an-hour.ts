      '$15/hour became a rallying cry for minimum wage advocacy through the "Fight for $15" movement launched in 2012. Today, this rate is the minimum wage in California, Washington, New York (NYC), and several other states and cities. Where it is not mandated, many major employers including Amazon, Target, and Costco have adopted it as their starting wage.',
      'At $31,200 annually, a full-time $15/hour worker earns just above the federal poverty line for a family of four ($31,200 vs. $31,200 in 2025). For single earners, this provides more financial cushion but still poses challenges in high-cost metros where rent alone can consume 50%+ of take-home pay.',
      'The Economic Policy Institute estimates that $15/hour provides a living wage in about half of U.S. counties, primarily in the Midwest and South. In coastal metros like San Francisco, New York, or Seattle, living wage calculations suggest $20-25/hour is necessary for basic self-sufficiency.',

    examples: [
      'Full-Time Worker: $15/hour × 40 hours × 52 weeks = $31,200/year. Monthly take-home after taxes: approximately $2,300-$2,450.',
      'Part-Time Worker (25 hours/week): $15 × 25 × 52 = $19,500/year.',
      'With Regular Overtime (10 hours/week): Regular $600 + OT $225 = $825/week = $42,900/year a 37% increase.',
