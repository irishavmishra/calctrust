      "Verify holiday policies annually: Employer holiday pay policies can change confirm current provisions each year",
      "Calculate blended rates carefully: Complex schedules mixing regular, 1.5x, and 2x hours require careful calculation",
      "Consider tax implications: Double-time earnings accelerate income, potentially pushing you into higher brackets faster"

    "assumptions": [
      "Standard 2x multiplier: Applies double time at exactly twice your regular hourly rate",
      "Input-based hours: Uses the overtime hours you specify without determining qualification automatically",
      "Gross pay only: Shows pre-tax earnings before deductions",

      "Non-exempt status: Assumes you're eligible for overtime premiums",
      "Employer-neutral: Doesn't account for specific employer policies on double-time qualification",
      "Direct calculation: Uses your regular rate without integrating bonuses or shift differentials"

    "commonMistakes": [

      "Forgetting consecutive workday requirements: California's seventh-day double time requires working all prior six days a gap resets the count",
      "Confusing policy with legal requirement: Even if an employer \"always\" paid double time, they may change the policy if not legally mandated",
      "Not tracking hours precisely: Double time often triggers after specific hour thresholds accurate daily tracking prevents missed wages",
      "Assuming all holidays qualify: Not all employers offer holiday premiums, and those that do may not include all holidays"
