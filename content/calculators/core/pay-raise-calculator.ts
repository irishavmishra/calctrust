      "According to compensation research, understanding raise expectations helps frame your own situation:",
      "Average annual raises by type (2024-2025 data): - Merit increases: 3.0-4.0% industry average - Cost of living adjustments: 2.5-3.5% tied to inflation - Promotional raises: 10-15% average when moving to a higher position - Market adjustments: 5-15% to align with competitive compensation data - Retention raises: 8-20% to counteract leaving for another opportunity",
      "The WorldatWork annual salary planning survey consistently shows base pay increases averaging 3-4% across industries, though this varies significantly by job function, company performance, and economic conditions.",
      "Consistent raises compound dramatically over a career. Consider a worker starting at $50,000:",
      "With 3% annual raises: - Year 1: $50,000 - Year 5: $57,964 - Year 10: $67,196 - Year 20: $90,306",
      "With 5% annual raises: - Year 1: $50,000 - Year 5: $63,814 - Year 10: $81,445 - Year 20: $132,665",
      "The difference between consistent 3% and 5% raises over 20 years: $42,359 per year by year 20. Early-career negotiation and job changes that maximize raise percentages pay dividends for decades.",
      "A raise isn't truly a raise unless it exceeds inflation. With inflation running 2-4% in typical years:",
      "- 3% raise with 3% inflation: Your purchasing power stays flat effectively no raise - 4% raise with 3% inflation: Real raise of only 1% - 5% raise with 3% inflation: Real raise of 2%",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index (CPI) tracks inflation, helping you assess whether your raise represents genuine improvement or merely keeping pace with rising costs.",
      "Understanding the difference helps set appropriate expectations:",
      "Merit increases (annual performance-based): - Typically 2-5% of base salary - Based on performance review ratings - Applied to current role - Common timing: annual review cycle",
      "Promotional raises (role advancement): - Typically 10-20% of base salary - Based on assuming greater responsibility - Moves you to a new job level - Timing varies based on opportunity",
      "A worker expecting a \"raise\" should clarify which type is under discussion the dollar implications differ substantially.",
      "- 70% of workers who ask for raises receive them - The average negotiation results in 4-5% above the initial offer - Most employees who receive below-average raises didn't ask for more - Counter-offers when leaving average 10-20% above current compensation",
      "However, the approach matters. Successful negotiations typically: - Present market data supporting the requested amount - Highlight specific accomplishments and contributions - Time requests appropriately (after project successes, during review cycles) - Frame asks positively rather than ultimatums",
      "Raises are taxed at your marginal rate, not your average rate. Understanding this prevents disappointment:",
      "Example: Current salary $60,000 (22% marginal bracket) - 5% raise = $3,000 additional income - Federal tax on raise: ~$660 (22%) - FICA on raise: ~$230 (7.65%) - State tax varies: ~$150 (5% example) - Net increase: ~$1,960 (65% of gross raise)",
      "Your raise \"feels like\" less because you're keeping about two-thirds of the additional income after taxes and deductions."

      "Standard Merit Raise - Current salary: $65,000 - Raise: 4% - New salary: $67,600** - Annual increase: $2,600 - Monthly increase: $216.67 - Hourly increase: $1.25",
      "Promotional Raise - Current salary: $75,000 - Raise: 12% (promotion to senior level) - New salary: $84,000** - Annual increase: $9,000 - Monthly increase: $750 - Hourly increase: $4.33",
      "Cost of Living Adjustment - Current salary: $55,000 - Raise: 3% (inflation adjustment) - New salary: $56,650** - Annual increase: $1,650 - Monthly increase: $137.50 - Net real raise: ~0% if inflation is 3%",
      "Aggressive Retention Offer - Current salary: $90,000 - Counter-offer when leaving: 15% - New salary: $103,500** - Annual increase: $13,500 - Monthly increase: $1,125 - Hourly increase: $6.49",
      "Entry-Level Progression - Starting salary: $45,000 - Year 2 raise: 5% → $47,250 - Year 3 raise: 6% → $50,085 - Year 4 raise: 10% promotion → $55,094 - After 3 years: 22% higher than starting**"

    "expertTips": [
      "Negotiate before accepting offers: It's easier to negotiate a raise into an offer than to ask for one after starting",
      "Document achievements quarterly: Build your case throughout the year, not just at review time",
      "Know your market value: Research comparable salaries using Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, PayScale, and Bureau of Labor Statistics data",
      "Consider total compensation: Raises aren't just salary equity, bonuses, benefits, and flexible work have value",
      "Time requests strategically: After successful project deliveries, strong quarterly results, or during favorable budget cycles",
      "Prepare to walk: The strongest negotiating position comes from genuine alternatives always know your options",
      "Put it in writing: Once agreed, get the raise confirmation documented to avoid misunderstandings",
      "Review your tax withholding: A significant raise may require W-4 adjustments to avoid over- or under-withholding"
    ],
    "assumptions": [
      "Annual salary basis: Calculations assume annual compensation as the input and output basis",
      "Standard work schedule: Hourly equivalents use 2,080 hours per year (40 hours × 52 weeks)",
      "Gross pay only: Results show pre-tax figures before any deductions",
      "Single raise applied: Calculates one raise at a time, not multiple raises or compounded increases",
      "Immediate application: Assumes the full raise applies from calculation forward, not prorated mid-year",
      "Base salary only: Doesn't factor in bonuses, equity, or other compensation elements"

    "commonMistakes": [
      "Comparing gross to net: A $5,000 raise doesn't add $5,000 to your bank account taxes take 25-40%",
      "Ignoring inflation: A 3% raise with 3% inflation means zero real improvement in purchasing power",
      "Not negotiating at hire: Starting salaries compound over your career $5,000 more at hire means much more over time",
      "Accepting first offers: Most offers have negotiation room; asking doesn't typically result in rescinded offers",
      "Focusing only on percentage: Context matters 4% on $50,000 differs vastly from 4% on $150,000",
      "Forgetting full compensation: Base salary is only part of the picture evaluate benefits, equity, and bonuses too",
      "Timing requests poorly: Asking after company layoffs or missed targets reduces success probability"

    "whyResultsVary": [
      "Tax bracket changes: Raises pushing you into higher brackets face steeper marginal taxation",
      "Benefit premium tiers: Some benefit costs scale with salary, reducing net gain",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "What is a good pay raise percentage?",
        "answer": "A typical annual merit raise is 3-4%. Raises of 5%+ are above average. Promotional raises average 10-15%. Any raise exceeding inflation represents real improvement."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I calculate my raise percentage?",
        "answer": "(New Salary - Old Salary) ÷ Old Salary × 100 = Raise Percentage. Example: ($65,000 - $60,000) ÷ $60,000 × 100 = 8.33% raise."
      },
      {
        "question": "Should I ask for a raise or look for a new job?",
        "answer": "Both options have merit. Job changes typically yield 10-20% increases, but consider benefits, culture, and opportunity when deciding. Sometimes staying and negotiating is optimal."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much of my raise will I actually see?",
        "answer": "Expect to keep 60-75% of gross raise after federal taxes, state taxes, and FICA. A $5,000 raise typically means $3,000-$3,750 additional take-home annually."
      },
      {
        "question": "When is the best time to ask for a raise?",
        "answer": "After successful project deliveries, strong performance reviews, during annual budget cycles, or when you have competing offers. Avoid asking during layoffs or financial stress."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often should I expect a raise?",
        "answer": "Most companies offer annual raise cycles tied to performance reviews. High performers at growth companies may see raises every 6-12 months."
