      "Many people believe bonuses are \"taxed higher\" than regular income. This is a misconception about withholding versus actual tax liability.",
      "The reality: Bonuses are taxed at your marginal rate—the same as any other income. However, they're often withheld at a flat rate for convenience, which may differ from your actual tax rate. Any over-withholding is refunded when you file taxes.",
      "Example: You earn $60,000 salary (22% bracket) and receive a $10,000 bonus. - Flat-rate withholding: 22% = $2,200 withheld - Your actual marginal rate: 22% - Result: Withholding matches actual liability (no refund or additional payment due to bonus taxation)",
      "But if you earn $40,000 salary (12% bracket) with a $5,000 bonus: - Flat-rate withholding: 22% = $1,100 withheld - Your actual marginal rate: 12% - Result: You've overpaid; expect a $500 refund",
      "The IRS specifies withholding methods for supplemental wages:",
      "Percentage Method (Flat Rate): - Bonus up to $1 million: 22% flat federal withholding - Bonus over $1 million: 37% on the excess above $1 million - Most common method for separately-identified bonuses",
      "Aggregate Method: - Combine bonus with most recent regular paycheck - Calculate withholding as if combined amount were a regular paycheck - Subtract withholding already applied to regular paycheck - Often results in higher withholding than flat rate for large bonuses",
      "Employers choose which method to use. Most opt for flat rate for simplicity, but some payroll systems default to aggregate method.",
      "States with no income tax (no additional withholding): Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming",
      "States with flat supplemental rates (examples): - California: 10.23% (or highest bracket rate) - New York: 11.7% (or marginal rate) - Illinois: 4.95% (same as regular income) - Colorado: 4.4% (same as regular income)",
      "States using aggregate method: Some states require aggregate method calculation mirroring federal aggregate approach.",
      "A California worker receiving a $20,000 bonus sees approximately 32.23% withheld for federal (22%) and state (10.23%) income taxes alone, before FICA.",
      "For bonuses exceeding $1 million: - First $1 million: 22% federal withholding - Amount over $1 million: 37% federal withholding (top bracket rate)",
      "Example: $1.5 million bonus - First $1M: $220,000 withheld - Remaining $500K: $185,000 withheld - Total federal withholding: $405,000 (27% effective rate)",
      "Bonuses are subject to the same FICA taxes as regular wages:",
      "- Social Security: 6.2% up to the wage base ($176,100 in 2025) - Medicare: 1.45% on all earnings - Additional Medicare: 0.9% on earnings over $200,000 (single)",
      "If your regular salary already exceeded the Social Security wage base, no additional Social Security tax applies to your bonus. This creates a slight \"FICA holiday\" on bonuses for high earners.",
      "Example: $200,000 salary with $50,000 bonus - SS already maxed on salary (6.2% × $176,100 = $10,918) - Bonus SS tax: $0 (wage base exceeded) - Bonus Medicare: $50,000 × 1.45% = $725 - Additional Medicare: $50,000 × 0.9% = $450 (income over $200K) - Total FICA on bonus: $1,175 (vs. $3,825 if not otherwise maxed)"

      "Expect about 60-70% take-home: Most bonuses in typical tax situations yield roughly 60-70% of gross after all withholding",

      "Time major purchases carefully: Bonus checks hit after withholding; don't commit to spending based on gross amount",
      "Consider 401(k) contributions: Many employers allow bonus-specific 401(k) contributions that reduce taxable amount",

    "assumptions": [
      "Flat-rate federal withholding: Uses 22% federal supplemental rate for bonuses under $1 million",
      "Separate identification: Assumes bonus is identified separately from regular wages (not aggregated)",
      "Current year rates: Uses 2025 tax rates and FICA limits",
      "Single withholding calculation: Shows one bonus scenario, not interaction with year-to-date wages",
      "Pre-tax bonus: The full bonus amount is subject to withholding calculation",

    "commonMistakes": [
      "Thinking bonuses are taxed at special higher rates: Bonuses are taxed at your marginal rate; the 22% is just default withholding",

      "Forgetting state taxes: Some states add significant additional withholding on supplemental wages",
      "Not adjusting W-4 for excessive withholding: If in 12% bracket but 22% is withheld, you're loaning the government money",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "Are bonuses taxed at a higher rate?",
        "answer": "No. Bonuses are taxed at your regular marginal rate. However, they're often withheld at a flat 22% federal rate, which may be higher or lower than your actual rate. Any difference is reconciled when filing your return."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does my bonus withholding seem so high?",
        "answer": "Employers typically withhold 22% federal (flat rate for supplemental wages) plus state taxes plus 7.65% FICA. Combined withholding of 35-40% is common, reducing gross to 60-65% net."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I get a refund on my bonus taxes?",
        "answer": "If you're in a tax bracket below 22% (12% or lower), you'll get a refund on the difference. If you're in a higher bracket (24%+), you may owe additional tax."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I reduce taxes on my bonus?",
        "answer": "Options include: contributing to traditional 401(k) from bonus, deferring bonus to lower-income year, timing bonus receipt strategically, and maximizing pre-tax deductions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there a way to avoid bonus withholding?",
        "answer": "No legal way exists to avoid withholding on employee bonuses. However, adjusting your W-4 can reduce overall withholding if you're confident you're overpaying."
      },
      {
        "question": "What if my bonus is over $1 million?",
        "answer": "Amounts over $1 million face 37% federal withholding (versus 22% on the first million). State and FICA apply as normal."
