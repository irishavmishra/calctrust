## How the Calculation Works

Bonus tax calculation differs from regular paycheck calculation:

1. **Identify the bonus amount**: Your gross supplemental payment before any deductions
2. **Determine withholding method**: Employers typically use either percentage method (flat rate) or aggregate method
3. **Apply federal withholding**: Flat 22% for bonuses up to $1 million, or aggregate with regular pay
4. **Apply state withholding**: State-specific rates for supplemental wages (varies widely)
5. **Calculate FICA**: Social Security (6.2% up to wage base) and Medicare (1.45% + potential surtax)
6. **Compute net bonus**: Gross bonus minus all withholding equals your take-home amount

**Flat Rate Formula**: Net Bonus ≈ Gross Bonus × (1 - 0.22 - State Rate - 0.0765)

## Deep Dive: How Bonuses Are Really Taxed

### The Flat Rate vs. Aggregate Method Misconception

Many people believe bonuses are "taxed higher" than regular income. This is a misconception about withholding versus actual tax liability.

**The reality**: Bonuses are taxed at your marginal rate—the same as any other income. However, they're often *withheld* at a flat rate for convenience, which may differ from your actual tax rate. Any over-withholding is refunded when you file taxes.

**Example**: You earn $60,000 salary (22% bracket) and receive a $10,000 bonus.
- Flat-rate withholding: 22% = $2,200 withheld
- Your actual marginal rate: 22%
- **Result**: Withholding matches actual liability (no refund or additional payment due to bonus taxation)

But if you earn $40,000 salary (12% bracket) with a $5,000 bonus:
- Flat-rate withholding: 22% = $1,100 withheld
- Your actual marginal rate: 12%
- **Result**: You've overpaid; expect a $500 refund

### IRS Supplemental Wage Withholding Rules

The IRS specifies withholding methods for supplemental wages:

**Percentage Method (Flat Rate)**:
- Bonus up to $1 million: 22% flat federal withholding
- Bonus over $1 million: 37% on the excess above $1 million
- Most common method for separately-identified bonuses

**Aggregate Method**:
- Combine bonus with most recent regular paycheck
- Calculate withholding as if combined amount were a regular paycheck
- Subtract withholding already applied to regular paycheck
- Often results in higher withholding than flat rate for large bonuses

Employers choose which method to use. Most opt for flat rate for simplicity, but some payroll systems default to aggregate method.

### State Tax Treatment of Bonuses

States handle supplemental wages differently:

**States with no income tax** (no additional withholding):
Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming

**States with flat supplemental rates** (examples):
- California: 10.23% (or highest bracket rate)
- New York: 11.7% (or marginal rate)
- Illinois: 4.95% (same as regular income)
- Colorado: 4.4% (same as regular income)

**States using aggregate method**:
Some states require aggregate method calculation mirroring federal aggregate approach.

A California worker receiving a $20,000 bonus sees approximately 32.23% withheld for federal (22%) and state (10.23%) income taxes alone, before FICA.

### The $1 Million Bonus Threshold

For bonuses exceeding $1 million:
- First $1 million: 22% federal withholding
- Amount over $1 million: 37% federal withholding (top bracket rate)

**Example**: $1.5 million bonus
- First $1M: $220,000 withheld
- Remaining $500K: $185,000 withheld
- **Total federal withholding: $405,000** (27% effective rate)

### FICA on Bonuses

Bonuses are subject to the same FICA taxes as regular wages:

- **Social Security**: 6.2% up to the wage base ($176,100 in 2025)
- **Medicare**: 1.45% on all earnings
- **Additional Medicare**: 0.9% on earnings over $200,000 (single)

If your regular salary already exceeded the Social Security wage base, no additional Social Security tax applies to your bonus. This creates a slight "FICA holiday" on bonuses for high earners.

**Example**: $200,000 salary with $50,000 bonus
- SS already maxed on salary (6.2% × $176,100 = $10,918)
- Bonus SS tax: $0 (wage base exceeded)
- Bonus Medicare: $50,000 × 1.45% = $725
- Additional Medicare: $50,000 × 0.9% = $450 (income over $200K)
- **Total FICA on bonus: $1,175** (vs. $3,825 if not otherwise maxed)

## Expert Tips & Considerations

- **Expect about 60-70% take-home**: Most bonuses in typical tax situations yield roughly 60-70% of gross after all withholding
- **Adjust your W-4 if over-withheld**: If you're in a lower bracket than 22%, consider adjusting withholding to reduce refund waiting
- **Time major purchases carefully**: Bonus checks hit after withholding; don't commit to spending based on gross amount
- **Consider 401(k) contributions**: Many employers allow bonus-specific 401(k) contributions that reduce taxable amount
- **Track for high earner thresholds**: Bonuses pushing income over $200K trigger additional Medicare tax
- **Remember Social Security cap**: Once salary exceeds $176,100, bonus faces lower FICA burden
- **State variations matter**: Moving from Texas to California adds 10%+ additional bonus withholding

## Assumptions Used

This calculator operates under these assumptions:

- **Flat-rate federal withholding**: Uses 22% federal supplemental rate for bonuses under $1 million
- **Separate identification**: Assumes bonus is identified separately from regular wages (not aggregated)
- **Current year rates**: Uses 2025 tax rates and FICA limits
- **Single withholding calculation**: Shows one bonus scenario, not interaction with year-to-date wages
- **Pre-tax bonus**: The full bonus amount is subject to withholding calculation
- **No pre-tax deductions applied**: Assumes no 401(k) or health insurance on bonus (some employers allow this)

---

## Common Mistakes People Make

- **Thinking bonuses are taxed at special higher rates**: Bonuses are taxed at your marginal rate; the 22% is just default withholding
- **Expecting full gross amount**: A $10,000 bonus yields roughly $6,500-7,000 net; budget accordingly
- **Forgetting state taxes**: Some states add significant additional withholding on supplemental wages
- **Not adjusting W-4 for excessive withholding**: If in 12% bracket but 22% is withheld, you're loaning the government money
- **Missing the Social Security cap opportunity**: High earners may see lower FICA on bonuses received after hitting wage base
- **Ignoring the aggregate method**: Some employers use methods that withhold more than flat rate; check your stub

---

## Why Results Can Vary by Situation

Actual bonus taxation may differ due to:

- **Withholding method used**: Aggregate method can result in significantly higher withholding than flat rate
- **Year-to-date earnings**: Whether you've already hit Social Security wage base affects FICA
- **State-specific rules**: States use different supplemental wage rates and methods
- **Additional Medicare tax**: Income over $200K triggers 0.9% additional tax
- **Pre-tax deductions**: Some employers allow 401(k) contributions on bonuses, reducing taxable amount
- **Final tax liability**: Actual taxes owed depend on total annual income; withholding is just estimated prepayment

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Are bonuses taxed at a higher rate?**
No. Bonuses are taxed at your regular marginal rate. However, they're often *withheld* at a flat 22% federal rate, which may be higher or lower than your actual rate. Any difference is reconciled when filing your return.

**Why does my bonus withholding seem so high?**
Employers typically withhold 22% federal (flat rate for supplemental wages) plus state taxes plus 7.65% FICA. Combined withholding of 35-40% is common, reducing gross to 60-65% net.

**Will I get a refund on my bonus taxes?**
If you're in a tax bracket below 22% (12% or lower), you'll get a refund on the difference. If you're in a higher bracket (24%+), you may owe additional tax.

**How can I reduce taxes on my bonus?**
Options include: contributing to traditional 401(k) from bonus, deferring bonus to lower-income year, timing bonus receipt strategically, and maximizing pre-tax deductions.

**Is there a way to avoid bonus withholding?**
No legal way exists to avoid withholding on employee bonuses. However, adjusting your W-4 can reduce overall withholding if you're confident you're overpaying.

**What if my bonus is over $1 million?**
Amounts over $1 million face 37% federal withholding (versus 22% on the first million). State and FICA apply as normal.
