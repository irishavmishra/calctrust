    "deepDive": [
      "According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, approximately 43% of U.S. workers receive biweekly pay—more than any other frequency. This popularity stems from several practical advantages:",
      "For employers: - Aligns with standard two-week pay periods - Simplifies overtime calculation (each period is exactly 80 hours) - Balances processing frequency against administrative costs",
      "For employees: - Regular, predictable income every 14 days - Two \"extra\" paychecks per year compared to semi-monthly - Easier overtime tracking and verification",
      "These terms are often confused but differ meaningfully:",
      "Biweekly (26 pay periods): - Every two weeks, same day (e.g., every other Friday) - 26 paychecks per year - Two months have 3 paychecks (bonus months!) - Consistent for hourly overtime calculations",
      "Semi-monthly (24 pay periods): - Twice per month on fixed dates (e.g., 1st and 15th) - 24 paychecks per year - Some periods have different day counts - Common for salaried workers",
      "Income comparison ($78,000 annual salary): - Biweekly: $78,000 ÷ 26 = $3,000 gross per check - Semi-monthly: $78,000 ÷ 24 = $3,250 gross per check",
      "Semi-monthly checks are larger, but you receive fewer of them.",
      "Biweekly pay creates a budgeting opportunity: two months each year have three paychecks instead of two.",
      "For workers who budget based on two paychecks monthly, the third paycheck is \"extra\" money that can fund: - Emergency fund contributions - Extra debt payments - Investment deposits - Large purchases or vacation savings",
      "In 2025, the three-paycheck months (for Friday paydays) are May and October.",
      "Federal withholding uses IRS Publication 15-T tables or percentage method calculations:",
      "Process (simplified): 1. Start with gross biweekly pay 2. Subtract pre-tax deductions (401k, health insurance) 3. Subtract per-period standard deduction equivalent (based on W-4 filing status) 4. Apply IRS withholding tables to the result 5. Multiply by applicable tax rates from bracket table",
      "The IRS provides withholding tables specifically for biweekly pay periods, which payroll systems use automatically.",
      "No state income tax (full check preserved): Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire (limited), South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming",
      "Flat rate states (predictable withholding): - Illinois: 4.95% - Colorado: 4.4% - Indiana: 3.05% - Pennsylvania: 3.07%",
      "Progressive rate states (bracket-based): - California: 1-13.3% - New York: 4-10.9% - New Jersey: 1.4-10.75% - Oregon: 4.75-9.9%",
      "A worker earning $75,000 sees drastically different biweekly net pay depending on state: - Texas (no state tax): ~$2,150 net - California (high state tax): ~$1,950 net - Difference: ~$200 per paycheck or $5,200 annually",
      "Regardless of income level or state, FICA applies consistently:",
      "Social Security: 6.2% on wages up to $176,100 (2025) Medicare: 1.45% on all wages Additional Medicare: 0.9% on wages over $200,000",
      "On a $3,000 biweekly gross: - Social Security: $186 - Medicare: $43.50 - Total FICA: $229.50 per check",
      "FICA applies from dollar one with no deductions or exemptions—it's truly unavoidable."

    "expertTips": [
      "Plan around three-paycheck months: Budget as if you receive two checks monthly; save the third for goals or emergencies",
      "Verify your first paycheck carefully: Ensure withholding matches your W-4 elections and deductions are correct",
      "Adjust W-4 if refund is too large: A refund means you overpaid monthly—adjust withholding to keep more each check",
      "Maximize 401(k) match: Ensure contributions are spread across all 26 pay periods to avoid missing match opportunities",
      "Track Social Security cap: High earners see increased net pay after wages exceed $176,100",
      "Consider biweekly mortgage payments: Paying half your mortgage every two weeks equals 13 payments yearly, accelerating payoff",
      "Use automatic transfers on payday: Set up recurring savings transfers that coincide with biweekly deposits"

      "2025 tax rates: Federal brackets and FICA limits reflect current year",
      "Standard withholding: Uses default W-4 assumptions unless specified",
      "Pre-tax deductions as specified: Applies entered 401(k) and benefit deductions",
      "Single state taxation: Assumes residence and work in one state",
      "No local taxes: Many cities add additional withholding not included here"

    "commonMistakes": [
      "Budgeting for 3 checks monthly: Only 2 months have 3 biweekly checks; base budget on 2 checks per month",

      "Not adjusting after life changes: Marriage, dependents, and job changes affect withholding—update W-4 accordingly",
      "Overlooking the FICA cap effect: High earners see net pay increase mid-year when Social Security caps",
      "Spending the \"extra\" checks: Treat bonus-month third checks as savings, not spending money",
      "Ignoring benefit election impacts: Health insurance changes at open enrollment affect net pay immediately"

      "W-4 elections: Claiming dependents, additional withholding, or extra exemptions changes federal tax",
      "State residency changes: Moving states mid-year affects state tax calculations",

    "faq": [
      {
        "question": "How many biweekly paychecks do I get per year?",
        "answer": "26 paychecks. Biweekly means every two weeks (52 weeks ÷ 2 = 26 pay periods)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is my biweekly check less than expected?",
        "answer": "Common reasons include: federal and state taxes, FICA (7.65%), 401(k) contributions, health insurance premiums, and other benefit deductions. Expect 25-35% of gross to go to deductions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between biweekly and semi-monthly?",
        "answer": "Biweekly = every two weeks, 26 times per year. Semi-monthly = twice per month (e.g., 1st and 15th), 24 times per year. Biweekly checks are slightly smaller but more frequent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which months have 3 paychecks in 2025?",
        "answer": "For Friday paydays, May and October 2025 have three biweekly paychecks. The specific months depend on your employer's pay dates."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I convert biweekly pay to monthly income?",
        "answer": "Multiply biweekly pay by 26, then divide by 12. Or multiply biweekly by 2.167 for approximate monthly equivalent."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I change my pay frequency?",
        "answer": "No; employers determine pay frequency. However, you can budget differently—treating biweekly income as semi-monthly by reserving extra in 3-check months."
