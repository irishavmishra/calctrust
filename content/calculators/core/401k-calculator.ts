      "A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan that offers significant tax advantages. Named after subsection 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, this plan was made possible by the Revenue Act of 1978 and has become the most popular private-market retirement plan in the United States.",
      "When you contribute to a 401(k), the money comes directly from your paycheck before taxes are calculated. This reduces your taxable income today while allowing your investments to grow tax-deferred until retirement. Many employers also match a portion of your contributions, essentially giving you free money toward retirement.",
      "The 2025 IRS contribution limit is $23,500 for employees under 50, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution allowed for those 50 and older. For workers aged 60-63, a special enhanced catch-up of $11,250 is available for 2025."

    "prosAndCons": [
      "PROS:",
      "• Tax-deferred growth: Contributions and earnings grow without annual taxation, allowing faster compound growth than taxable accounts",
      "• Employer matching: Many employers match 50-100% of contributions up to a certain percentage—this is essentially free money and an immediate guaranteed return",
      "• High contribution limits: The 2025 limit of $23,500 ($31,000 if 50+) far exceeds IRA limits of $7,000-$8,000",
      "• Tax-deductible contributions: Every dollar contributed reduces your current taxable income, lowering your tax bill today",
      "• Creditor protection: 401(k) funds are generally protected from bankruptcy and creditor claims",
      "• Automatic payroll deduction: Contributions happen automatically, making consistent saving effortless",
      "",
      "CONS:",
      "• Limited investment options: You're restricted to the funds your employer's plan offers, which may have higher fees than you'd choose independently",
      "• Higher fees: 401(k) plans often charge administrative fees that can eat into returns over time",
      "• Illiquidity: Funds generally can't be withdrawn without penalty before age 59½",
      "• Vesting schedules: Employer contributions may not fully belong to you until you've worked there several years",
      "• Required minimum distributions: You must begin withdrawals at age 73, even if you don't need the money",
      "• Early withdrawal penalties: Taking money out before 59½ incurs a 10% penalty plus income taxes"
    ],
    "howItWorks": [
      "Traditional 401(k) contributions are deducted from your paycheck before federal and state income taxes are calculated. This provides an immediate tax benefit—if you're in the 24% tax bracket, a $1,000 contribution only reduces your take-home pay by about $760.",
      "Your contributions, along with any employer match and investment earnings, grow tax-deferred. This means you don't pay taxes on dividends, interest, or capital gains each year. The full value continues compounding until you withdraw funds in retirement.",
      "When you withdraw money in retirement (after age 59½), distributions are taxed as ordinary income. Most retirees are in lower tax brackets than during their working years, resulting in lower overall taxation on the money."

      "UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYER MATCHING",

      "• Dollar-for-dollar match on first 3%: Contribute 3% and get 3% from your employer—a 100% instant return",

      "Most 401(k) plans offer these investment types:",

      "• Index funds: Low-cost funds tracking market indices like the S&P 500",
      "• Actively managed funds: Higher fees with goal of beating market returns",

      "Start early, even with small amounts: Time in the market beats timing the market. A 25-year-old who saves $200/month will have more at 65 than a 35-year-old saving $400/month",
      "Choose low-cost index funds: Minimize expense ratios—a 0.5% fee difference can cost you $100,000+ over a 30-year career",

      {
        "question": "What is a 401(k) and how does it work?",
        "answer": "A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan. Money is deducted from your paycheck before taxes, reducing your current taxable income. Funds grow tax-deferred until withdrawal in retirement. Many employers match a portion of your contributions, essentially giving you free money."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much can I contribute to my 401(k) in 2025?",
        "answer": "In 2025, you can contribute up to $23,500 to your 401(k). If you're 50 or older, you can add an extra $7,500 catch-up contribution for a total of $31,000. Workers aged 60-63 get an enhanced catch-up of $11,250. The combined limit (employee + employer) is $70,000."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is an employer 401(k) match?",
        "answer": "An employer match is when your company contributes additional money to your 401(k) based on what you contribute. For example, a '50% match on the first 6%' means if you contribute 6% of your salary, your employer adds 3%. This is essentially free money you should always capture."
      },
      {
        "question": "When can I withdraw from my 401(k) without penalty?",
        "answer": "You can take penalty-free withdrawals starting at age 59½. Earlier withdrawals typically incur a 10% penalty plus income taxes. Exceptions include disability, certain medical expenses, and separation from service after age 55 (Rule of 55)."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between Roth and Traditional 401(k)?",
        "answer": "Traditional 401(k) contributions are pre-tax (you save taxes now, pay later). Roth 401(k) contributions are after-tax (you pay taxes now, withdraw tax-free later). Traditional is often better for high earners; Roth may benefit younger workers in lower tax brackets."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens to my 401(k) if I leave my job?",
        "answer": "You have four options: 1) Leave it with your former employer (if allowed), 2) Roll it over to your new employer's plan, 3) Roll it into an IRA, 4) Cash out (not recommended due to taxes and 10% penalty). Rollovers preserve tax-advantaged growth."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a 401(k) vesting schedule?",
        "answer": "Vesting determines when employer contributions become fully yours. Your own contributions are always 100% vested. Employer contributions may vest gradually (20% per year) or all at once after 3+ years (cliff vesting). Unvested funds are forfeited if you leave."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)?",
        "answer": "Starting at age 73, you must withdraw a minimum amount from traditional 401(k) accounts annually. The amount is based on your account balance and life expectancy. Failure to take RMDs results in a 25% penalty on the amount not withdrawn."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can self-employed people have a 401(k)?",
        "answer": "Yes, self-employed individuals can open a Solo 401(k) (also called individual 401(k)). This allows contributions as both employee ($23,500) and employer (up to 25% of net income), potentially saving up to $70,000 per year. Roth options and loans are available."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much should I contribute to my 401(k)?",
        "answer": "At minimum, contribute enough to capture your full employer match—this is free money. Financial advisors typically recommend saving 10-15% of salary (including employer match) for retirement. More is better if affordable, especially for late starters."
